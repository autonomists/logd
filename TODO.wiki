= TODO =

- logger shouldn't care about subscribers, events should do that logic
    - events -> sockets
        - if socket gets a read/tail command, must pass messages from
          response.msgC through the socket
- connection state, timeouts, graceful shutdown
- test/benchmark sockets using a NilLogger
- test/benchmark with different configs
- abstract protocol from sockets/events
- integration test for correct starting id, partition, and offset on startup
  after writing some data to the log
- test that read forever command on empty log doesn't crash
